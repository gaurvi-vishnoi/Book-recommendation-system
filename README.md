# Book-recommendation-system
A recommendation system filters information by predicting ratings or preferences of customers for items that the customers would like to use. It tries to recommend items to the customers according to their needs and taste.
With this Machine Learning Project, we build a book recommendation system. For this project, we will be using the KNearst Neighbor algorithm.
